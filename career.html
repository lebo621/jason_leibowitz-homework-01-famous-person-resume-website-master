      Highlights of Radiohead's Career:
    </h3>

    <ul class="career_list">
      <li>We caught our big break with the song <strong class="links"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFkzRNyygfk" target="_blank">Creep</a></strong> on our first album: <em class="album">Pablo Honey</em>.</li>

      <li>Our second album, <em class="album">The Bends</em>, was fantastic rock n' roll.</li>

      <li>Album three, <em class="album">OK Computer</em>, was ground-breaking and revolutionary.</li>

      <li>It's now the year 2000, we all survived Y2K and it was time to change the sound of rock by introducing computers into production. Enter our next album, <em class="album">Kid A</em>. Our band's sound was beginning to navigate into unchartered waters. You be the judge: <strong class="links"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRmh__q6YIM" target="_blank">Everything In Its Right Place</a></strong>.</li>

      <li>One year later we released our fifth album, <em class="album">Amnesiac</em>. More computers, more cool sounds.</li>

      <li><em class="album">Hail to the Thief</em> was our next album and had unique, weird but amazing songs. Check out the music video for <strong class="links"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzW-fDNEJ0" target="_blank">There, There</a></strong>.</li>

      <li>We changed the rules of the record industry when we released our next album, <em class="album">In Rainbows</em>, online, without a label, and for free. F' the system!</li>

      <li><em class="album">The King of Limbs</em> was album number eight in 2011. I like this one very much.</li>

      <li><em class="album">A Moon Shaped Pool</em>, our latest album, was released on May 8, 2016. It is a work of art. Feel free to click on the album below to purchase it. Enjoy!</li>
