      <h2>I AM AN ARTIST<br>I SING</h2>

      <h3>Hello</h3>

      <p>
        I'm Thom Yorke. I am the lead singer of the band <em class="band_name">Radiohead</em>. We have just released our 9th studio album, titled <em class="album">A Moon Shaped Pool</em>, and I am quite proud of it. We are currently going on tour, so if you live on planet Earth, feel free to come listen to us play music.

      A Bit of Background About My Life
    </h3> 

    <p>
      I grew up in Northamptonshire, UK. I started playing guitar when I was 7 years old, and at 11 I wrote my first song and joined a band. I met my current bandmates when I was a teen at school, and our original band name was <em class="band_name">On A Friday</em>. Several years later, in 1991, we signed onto a record label and changed our band name to <em class="band_name">Radiohead</em>.
